- Arizona and Wisconsin follow, while other states contribute minimally.  
- Revenue concentration is heavily skewed toward California.  

ðŸ‘‰ *Insight*: California is the strongest market; marketing and distribution efforts should be prioritized here.

### 2. Revenue by Year  
- The dashboard shows only **2014** with $48,225 in total revenue.

- Top profit contributors:  
  - **Xerox 1916** â†’ $12,285  
  - **Xerox 1967** â†’ $7,123  
- Other products generated less than $5,000 each.  

ðŸ‘‰ *Insight*: Xerox products are highly profitable and should remain a core focus.  

---

### 4. Top 10 Products by Quantity  
- Best-selling products include **Conference Tables, Xerox papers, Tyvek Peel & Seal, and Binders**.  
- However, high sales volume does not always equal high profit.

### 6. Profit by State  
- **California** again leads in profitability.  
- Other states show low or near-zero profit contribution.  

ðŸ‘‰ *Insight*: Heavy reliance on California poses a risk; market diversification is needed.
